### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the project performance of a company over the past year. By analyzing various aspects of the project data, I seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's budget performance.

### Data Sources

Project Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Employees project.zip" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### Tools

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- Who are the key employees involved, and what are their roles?
- Can you provide an overview of the project distribution across teams or departments?
- How is the budget allocated across different projects or initiatives?
- How is the project cost allocated across different projects or initiatives?
- Detail table view.

### Data Analysis
Include some interesting code/features worked with

```sql
-- project status
WITH project_status AS
(SELECT project_id, project_name, project_budget, department_id, 'completed' AS status
FROM completed_projects
UNION ALL
SELECT project_id, project_name, project_budget, department_id, 'upcoming' AS status
FROM upcoming_projects)

-- Big Table
SELECT e.employee_id,
	   e.first_name,
	   e.last_name,
	   e.department_id,
	   e.job_title,
	   e.salary,
	   d.Department_Name,
	   d.Department_Budget,
	   d.Department_Goals,
	   ps.project_budget,
	   pa.project_id,
	   ps.project_name,
	   ps.status
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d
ON e.department_id = d.Department_ID
JOIN project_assignments pa
ON pa.employee_id = e.employee_id
JOIN project_status ps
ON ps.project_id = pa.project_id
